# Algorand Smart Contract Security Best Practices

Smart contracts on Algorand manage real value and a single vulnerability can result in irreversible loss of funds. Unlike traditional software, deployed contracts are immutable by default and operate in an adversarial environment where every transaction is public and anyone can interact with your program. Therefore, security has to be built in from the start.

This guide is a practical security reference for Algorand developers using **Algorand TypeScript** and **Algorand Python**. It covers the most common vulnerabilities — from access control flaws and unchecked transaction fees to arithmetic overflows and rekeying attacks — with concrete code examples showing both the vulnerable pattern and the secure fix.

Whether you're building your first contract or preparing for a mainnet launch, use this as a resource to harden your application before it holds real assets.

> **Disclaimer:** This guide covers common vulnerabilities and best practices but is not exhaustive. Always have your contracts audited by a professional security firm before deploying to mainnet with real value.

## How to Read This Guide

Each section highlights risks with concrete code examples. Headings are categorized by the nature of the risk:

- **Vulnerable / Fixed**: Exploitable security flaws where an attacker can steal funds, bypass access control, or manipulate contract behavior, shown alongside the secure correction.
- **DON'T / DO**: Defensive best practices that aren't directly exploitable but lead to fragility, denial of service, or operational risk.
- **Pattern**: Recommended implementation approaches.

## 1. Smart Contracts vs Logic Signatures

[Logic Signatures](https://dev.algorand.co/concepts/smart-contracts/logic-sigs/) (LogicSigs) are programs that authorize transactions. If the program returns non-zero, the transaction is approved. They operate in two modes:

1. **Contract Account** - the compiled program hash becomes an escrow address with no private key
2. **Delegated** - an account owner signs the program, letting anyone with the signed program transact on their behalf.

LogicSigs are powerful but dangerous, especially in delegated mode, where a single missing check can permanently compromise the signer's account. **Prefer smart contracts** where possible.

### Risk

Regardless of mode, LogicSigs are more dangerous than smart contracts because:

- **No state:** A LogicSig cannot track whether it has already approved a transaction, making replay attacks possible unless explicitly prevented, e.g. if the `Lease`, `First Round Valid` and `Last Round Valid` fields are constrained.
- **Public bytecode:** After the first transaction, the bytecode of a LogicSig account is on-chain. Anyone can reconstruct it and submit new transactions using the LogicSig.
- **Delegated authority:** Anyone who obtains the signed program of a delegated account can transact from the signer's personal account. The only way to revoke this delegation is to **permanently** change the account authorizer via rekeying.
- **Arguments are not signed:** LogicSig arguments are public and they are **not** covered by the delegation signature, **not** part of the transaction ID, and **not** part of the group ID. Anyone constructing a transaction with the LogicSig can supply arbitrary arguments. The program must not rely on arguments for security-critical checks.
- **Dangerous fields unchecked by default:** If the program doesn't explicitly check `RekeyTo`, `CloseRemainderTo`, and `AssetCloseTo`, an attacker can drain the account or take permanent control.
- **Cross-network reuse:** The same compiled program works on mainnet, testnet, and betanet unless `Global.genesisHash` is checked.

### DO: Follow the LogicSig Security Checklist

Every LogicSig — whether Contract Account or Delegated — **MUST** verify:

1. **`RekeyTo == ZeroAddress`:** Prevent permanent account takeover
2. **`CloseRemainderTo == ZeroAddress`:** Prevent draining all ALGO
3. **`AssetCloseTo == ZeroAddress`:** Prevent draining all units of an asset (if applicable)
4. **`Fee` bounded:** Prevent fee extraction (use `Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee`)
5. **Transaction type restricted:** Only allow the intended type (e.g., `Payment`)
6. **Use `txn`, not `gtxn`, for self-validation:** If using `gtxn`, also check `txn GroupIndex` to pin the LogicSig to a specific position. Otherwise an attacker can reuse the same LogicSig on multiple transactions in a group, where only the first is checked and the rest are unconstrained.
7. **`GenesisHash` checked:** Network restriction (if the LogicSig should only work on one network)
8. **Replay protection**: Depending on the use case, the logic sig should not be arbitrarily replayable. Secure examples include delegated logic signatures that bind the validity window (first/last valid rounds) and a specific `lease`, or logic sigs that pair with a smart contract call that performs stateful checks.
9. **`LastValid` bounded:** Expiration (if the authorization should not last forever)

See sections [3 (Fee Management)](#3-fee-management) and [6 (Rekeying)](#6-rekeying--account-draining) for in-depth coverage. Replay protection, unsigned arguments, and cross-network reuse are covered below in this section.

### Vulnerable: Delegated LogicSig without safety checks

A delegated LogicSig that only checks the amount. Everything else is unvalidated. If Alice signs this program, anyone who obtains it can transact from Alice's account.

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import { LogicSig, Txn, Uint64 } from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

// VULNERABLE: Only checks amount — allows rekeying, closing, and replay
class UnsafePaymentSig extends LogicSig {
  public program(): boolean {
    return Txn.amount <= Uint64(1_000_000);
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — VULNERABLE

```python
from algopy import logicsig, Txn, UInt64

# VULNERABLE: Allows rekeying, closing, and replay
@logicsig
def unsafe_payment_sig() -> bool:
    # Only checks amount — everything else is unvalidated
    return Txn.amount <= UInt64(1_000_000)
```

**An attacker with the signed program can:**

1. Set `RekeyTo` to their own address and **permanently steal Alice's account**
2. Set `CloseRemainderTo` to drain **all ALGO** in a single transaction
3. Replay the same transaction repeatedly (no lease required)
4. Send to any receiver (no recipient restriction)

### Fixed: Delegated LogicSig with full safety checks

The safe version locks down every dangerous field. Alice delegates to Bob. Bob can pull up to 1 ALGO per transaction, but only to a pre-specified receiver, with replay protection:

TODO - not actually safe. By "replay protection" I'm assuming this is intended to be "execute once", so you need to bind first/last round as well. Lease lifetime is [first, last] round, which is attacker controlled, so they can execute one of these every ~2 rounds, unbounded.

TODO - With the exception of a "safe" delegated payemnt, I would change most logic sig examples here to be application calls with templated app ID, selector + oncomplete=noop

Algorand TypeScript — SAFE

```typescript
import {
  LogicSig,
  Txn,
  Global,
  Uint64,
  TransactionType,
  TemplateVar,
  Account,
  type bytes,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

// SAFE: All checks including receiver restriction via TemplateVar
class SafePaymentSig extends LogicSig {
  public program(): boolean {
    return (
      Txn.typeEnum === TransactionType.Payment &&
      Txn.amount <= Uint64(1_000_000) &&
      Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee &&
      Txn.rekeyTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.closeRemainderTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.lease === TemplateVar<bytes>("LEASE") &&
      Txn.receiver === TemplateVar<Account>("INTENDED_RECEIVER")
    );
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — SAFE

```python
from algopy import logicsig, Txn, Global, UInt64, Bytes, TransactionType, TemplateVar, Account

@logicsig
def safe_payment_sig() -> bool:
    return (
        Txn.type_enum == TransactionType.Payment
        and Txn.amount <= UInt64(1_000_000)
        and Txn.fee <= Global.min_txn_fee
        and Txn.rekey_to == Global.zero_address          # Prevent rekeying
        and Txn.close_remainder_to == Global.zero_address # Prevent draining
        and Txn.lease == TemplateVar[Bytes]("LEASE")        # Pin lease for replay protection
        and Txn.receiver == TemplateVar[Account]("INTENDED_RECEIVER")  # Restrict recipient
    )
```

> **Runnable examples:** [UnsafePaymentSig & SafePaymentSig source](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/1-smart-contracts-vs-logic-signatures/delegated-logic-sig.algo.ts) | [Unit Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/1-smart-contracts-vs-logic-signatures/delegated-logic-sig.algo.spec.ts) | [E2E Usage](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/1-smart-contracts-vs-logic-signatures/delegated-logic-sig.e2e.spec.ts)

This is correct but fragile. Miss any single check and Alice's account is compromised.

### Pattern: Escrow LogicSig (Contract Account Mode)

A Contract Account escrow that releases funds only to a specific recipient, with amount limits and an expiration round. The compiled program hash _is_ the escrow address. Fund it, and anyone with the bytecode can submit withdrawals that satisfy all conditions.

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
import {
  LogicSig,
  Txn,
  Global,
  TransactionType,
  TemplateVar,
  Account,
  type uint64,
  type bytes,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

// SAFE: Contract Account escrow — the compiled program hash IS the escrow address
class EscrowSig extends LogicSig {
  program(): boolean {
    return (
      Txn.typeEnum === TransactionType.Payment &&
      Txn.receiver === TemplateVar<Account>("RECIPIENT") &&
      Txn.amount <= TemplateVar<uint64>("MAX_AMOUNT") &&
      Txn.rekeyTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.closeRemainderTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee &&
      Txn.lease === TemplateVar<bytes>("LEASE") &&
      Txn.lastValid <= TemplateVar<uint64>("EXPIRATION_ROUND")
    );
  }
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
from algopy import logicsig, Txn, Global, UInt64, Bytes, TransactionType, TemplateVar, Account

# SAFE: Contract Account escrow — the compiled program hash IS the escrow address
@logicsig
def escrow_sig() -> bool:
    return (
        Txn.type_enum == TransactionType.Payment
        and Txn.receiver == TemplateVar[Account]("RECIPIENT")
        and Txn.amount <= TemplateVar[UInt64]("MAX_AMOUNT")
        and Txn.rekey_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.close_remainder_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.fee <= Global.min_txn_fee
        and Txn.lease == TemplateVar[Bytes]("LEASE")
        and Txn.last_valid <= TemplateVar[UInt64]("EXPIRATION_ROUND")
    )
```

> **Runnable examples:** [EscrowSig source](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/1-smart-contracts-vs-logic-signatures/escrow-logic-sig.algo.ts) | [Unit Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/1-smart-contracts-vs-logic-signatures/escrow-logic-sig.algo.spec.ts) | [E2E Usage](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/1-smart-contracts-vs-logic-signatures/escrow-logic-sig.e2e.spec.ts)

**How it works:** Compile the program with template values (recipient address, max amount, expiration round) → the hash becomes the escrow address → fund that address → anyone with the bytecode can submit a payment that satisfies all conditions. The `TemplateVar` values are baked into the compiled bytecode, so they cannot be changed after deployment.

### DON'T: Use LogicSig arguments for access control

LogicSig arguments are **not covered by the transaction signature**. In delegated mode, the signer's signature covers only the program bytecode — not the arguments. In contract account mode, there is no signature at all; the program hash is the address. In both cases, anyone constructing a transaction can supply whatever arguments they want.

This means arguments must never be used for access control or to restrict who can use a LogicSig. Consider a LogicSig that uses an argument as a "password":

### Vulnerable: LogicSig using arguments for access control

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import { Bytes, LogicSig, Txn, Global, TransactionType, op } from '@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript'

// VULNERABLE: LogicSig arguments are NOT signed — anyone who sees one valid
// transaction can copy the "password" argument and reuse it to drain the escrow.
export class UnsafeArgSig extends LogicSig {
  public program(): boolean {
    return (
      Txn.typeEnum === TransactionType.Payment &&
      Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee &&
      Txn.rekeyTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.closeRemainderTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      // "Secret" password — provides zero security because args are public
      op.arg(0) === Bytes('s3cret')
    )
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — VULNERABLE

```python
from algopy import logicsig, Txn, Global, Bytes, TransactionType, op

# VULNERABLE: LogicSig arguments are NOT signed — anyone who sees one valid
# transaction can copy the "password" argument and reuse it to drain the escrow.
@logicsig
def unsafe_arg_sig() -> bool:
    return (
        Txn.type_enum == TransactionType.Payment
        and Txn.fee <= Global.min_txn_fee
        and Txn.rekey_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.close_remainder_to == Global.zero_address
        # "Secret" password — provides zero security because args are public
        and op.arg(0) == Bytes(b"s3cret")
    )
```

The developer's intent is that only someone who knows the password can trigger payments from this escrow. This fails for multiple reasons:

1. **The password is the only gate.** The receiver is not constrained, so an attacker who knows the password can send funds to any address. Even if you checked the receiver against a second argument (e.g., `Txn.receiver == op.arg(1)`), the attacker controls all arguments and can set both the password and the receiver to whatever they want.

2. **The password is plainly visible.** The compiled TEAL contains `pushbytes "s3cret"` in plain text. Anyone who reads the bytecode discovers it immediately. The argument values are also visible in the transaction history of every transaction that uses the LogicSig.

3. **Using `TemplateVar` for the password doesn't help.** You might think baking the password into the bytecode via `TemplateVar<bytes>('PASSWORD')` instead of `op.arg(0)` is more secure, since the attacker can no longer swap in a different value. But the substituted value is still embedded in plain text in the compiled TEAL (e.g., `pushbytes "s3cret"`). An attacker reads the program from on-chain transaction history, finds the password, and uses it. LogicSigs cannot keep secrets.

> **Runnable examples:** [UnsafeArgSig source](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/7-group-transaction-security/unsigned-args.algo.ts) | [Unit Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/7-group-transaction-security/unsigned-args.algo.spec.ts) | [E2E Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/7-group-transaction-security/unsigned-args.e2e.spec.ts)

### DO: Use Lease + bounded LastValid for replay protection

If a LogicSig authorizes transactions based on time windows (e.g., "allow one payment per day"), an attacker can submit the same transaction multiple times within the same window. The LogicSig has no state to track previous executions. This affects both modes: in **Contract Account** mode, anyone with the bytecode can replay withdrawals; in **Delegated** mode, anyone with the signed program can replay spending.

The `Lease` field together with a bounded `LastValid` prevents this. A lease is a 32-byte value that, combined with the sender, prevents duplicate transactions within the same round range (`FirstValid` to `LastValid`). Bounding `LastValid` limits how long the LogicSig can be used. Together they ensure at most one transaction per validity window. Both LogicSig examples above — SafePaymentSig and EscrowSig — include `Lease` and `LastValid` checks.

### DO: Check GenesisHash for network-specific LogicSigs

A LogicSig compiled on testnet works identically on mainnet. If a LogicSig should only operate on a specific network, it must explicitly check the genesis hash.

### DON'T: Deploy LogicSigs without network restriction

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import { LogicSig, Txn, Global, TransactionType, Uint64, TemplateVar, type bytes } from '@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript'

// VULNERABLE: No genesis hash check — this LogicSig works on any network.
// An attacker can reuse it on mainnet if it was only intended for testnet.
export class CrossNetworkSig extends LogicSig {
  program(): boolean {
    return (
      Txn.typeEnum === TransactionType.Payment &&
      Txn.amount <= Uint64(1_000_000) &&
      Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee &&
      Txn.rekeyTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.closeRemainderTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.receiver === TemplateVar<bytes>("RECEIVER")
    )
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — VULNERABLE

```python
from algopy import logicsig, Txn, Global, UInt64, Bytes, TransactionType, TemplateVar

# VULNERABLE: No genesis hash check — this LogicSig works on any network.
# An attacker can reuse it on mainnet if it was only intended for testnet.
@logicsig
def cross_network_sig() -> bool:
    return (
        Txn.type_enum == TransactionType.Payment
        and Txn.amount <= UInt64(1_000_000)
        and Txn.fee <= Global.min_txn_fee
        and Txn.rekey_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.close_remainder_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.receiver == TemplateVar[Bytes]("RECEIVER")
    )
```

### DO: Restrict LogicSigs to a specific network

Algorand TypeScript — SAFE

```typescript
import { LogicSig, Txn, Global, TransactionType, Uint64, TemplateVar, type bytes } from '@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript'

// SAFE: Genesis hash check pins this LogicSig to one network.
export class NetworkRestrictedSig extends LogicSig {
  program(): boolean {
    return (
      Txn.typeEnum === TransactionType.Payment &&
      Txn.amount <= Uint64(1_000_000) &&
      Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee &&
      Txn.rekeyTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.closeRemainderTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.receiver === TemplateVar<bytes>("RECEIVER") &&
      // Pin to a specific network — prevents cross-network reuse
      Global.genesisHash === TemplateVar<bytes>("GENESIS_HASH")
    )
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — SAFE

```python
from algopy import logicsig, Txn, Global, UInt64, Bytes, TransactionType, TemplateVar

# SAFE: Genesis hash check pins this LogicSig to one network.
@logicsig
def network_restricted_sig() -> bool:
    return (
        Txn.type_enum == TransactionType.Payment
        and Txn.amount <= UInt64(1_000_000)
        and Txn.fee <= Global.min_txn_fee
        and Txn.rekey_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.close_remainder_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.receiver == TemplateVar[Bytes]("RECEIVER")
        # Pin to a specific network — prevents cross-network reuse
        and Global.genesis_hash == TemplateVar[Bytes]("GENESIS_HASH")
    )
```

### DO: Prefer Smart Contracts

Both LogicSig examples above are fragile. Compare with the smart contract equivalent, which gets most of these protections for free:

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Txn,
  Global,
  assert,
  Uint64,
  itxn,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

export class SafePaymentManager extends Contract {
  public authorizePayment(receiver: Account, amount: uint64): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Only creator can authorize");
    assert(amount <= Uint64(1_000_000), "Amount exceeds limit");

    itxn
      .payment({
        receiver: receiver,
        amount: amount,
        fee: Uint64(0),
      })
      .submit();
  }
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, Txn, Global, arc4, Account, UInt64, itxn

class SafePaymentManager(ARC4Contract):
    @arc4.abimethod
    def authorize_payment(self, receiver: Account, amount: UInt64) -> None:
        assert Txn.sender == Global.creator_address, "Only creator can authorize"
        assert amount <= UInt64(1_000_000), "Amount exceeds limit"

        itxn.Payment(
            receiver=receiver,
            amount=amount,
            fee=0,
        ).submit()
```

> **Runnable examples:** [SafePaymentManager source](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/1-smart-contracts-vs-logic-signatures/safe-payment-manager.algo.ts) | [Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/1-smart-contracts-vs-logic-signatures/safe-payment-manager.e2e.spec.ts)

The application account can't be closed, can't be rekeyed, and inner transaction fees default to the minimum. These are all things that LogicSigs must guard against manually and can easily get wrong.

### Key Takeaways

- **Understand which mode you're using:** Contract Account (no key, deterministic address) vs Delegated (signed program, someone else's account) and its implications.
- **Follow the [security checklist](#do-follow-the-logicsig-security-checklist)** for every LogicSig: `RekeyTo`, `CloseRemainderTo`, `AssetCloseTo`, `Fee`, type, `Lease`, `GenesisHash`, `LastValid`.
- **Never trust LogicSig arguments for access control:** they are not signed and anyone can supply arbitrary values.
- **Check `Global.genesisHash`** in network-specific LogicSigs to prevent cross-network reuse.
- **Default to smart contracts** unless you have a specific reason not to. They give you access control, state, and composability for free.

### DON'T: Assume delegated LogicSigs can be revoked

A signed delegated LogicSig is as sensitive as a private key. Anyone who obtains it can submit transactions from the delegator's account. Follow the [security checklist](#do-follow-the-logicsig-security-checklist) to scope it narrowly, and encrypt it at rest.

There is no protocol-level mechanism to revoke a delegated LogicSig. If one is compromised, the **only remedy is to [rekey the account](#6-rekeying--account-draining) immediately**. Rekeying invalidates the original signing key, rendering all previously signed LogicSigs unusable.

## 2. Access Control

### Risk

Algorand TypeScript and Algorand Python **reject update and delete operations by default**. If you don't define `updateApplication` or `deleteApplication` handlers, no one, not even the creator, can update or delete the contract. However, any ABI method you define is callable by any account unless you add explicit authorization checks.

The risk arises when you **do** define these handlers (because you need the contract to be upgradeable) but forget to add access control. Without checks, **any account** can call your handler and replace the contract code or delete the application, stealing all funds held by the application address.

**Note:** In raw TEAL, the opposite applies. Update and delete are allowed unless the program explicitly rejects them.

### DO: Restrict update and delete handlers. Or don't define them at all

If your contract needs to be updatable or deletable, always restrict those operations to authorized accounts. If it doesn't need to be updatable, simply don't define the handlers. PuyaTs/PuyaPy will reject those calls automatically.

### Vulnerable: Update/delete handlers without access control

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import { Contract } from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

// VULNERABLE: Update/delete handlers exist but have no access control
export class VulnerableContract extends Contract {
  public updateApplication(): void {
    // No access control — anyone can replace this contract's code
  }

  public deleteApplication(): void {
    // No access control — anyone can delete this contract
  }

  public doSomething(): void {
    // business logic
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — VULNERABLE

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, arc4

# VULNERABLE: Update/delete handlers exist but have no access control
class VulnerableContract(ARC4Contract):
    @arc4.abimethod(allow_actions=["UpdateApplication"])
    def update(self) -> None:
        # No access control — anyone can replace this contract's code
        pass

    @arc4.abimethod(allow_actions=["DeleteApplication"])
    def delete(self) -> None:
        # No access control — anyone can delete this contract
        pass

    @arc4.abimethod
    def do_something(self) -> None:
        # business logic
        pass
```

### Fixed: Creator-only access control

Algorand TypeScript — SAFE

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Txn,
  Global,
  assert,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

export class SecureContract extends Contract {
  public updateApplication(): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Only creator can update");
  }

  public deleteApplication(): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Only creator can delete");
  }

  public doSomething(): void {
    // business logic
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — SAFE

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, Txn, arc4

class SecureContract(ARC4Contract):
    @arc4.abimethod(allow_actions=["UpdateApplication"])
    def update(self) -> None:
        assert Txn.sender == self.creator, "Only creator can update"

    @arc4.abimethod(allow_actions=["DeleteApplication"])
    def delete(self) -> None:
        assert Txn.sender == self.creator, "Only creator can delete"

    @arc4.abimethod
    def do_something(self) -> None:
        # business logic
        pass
```

### DON'T: Allow deletion while the contract still holds funds

Even with proper access control, deleting a contract while its application account still holds ALGO or ASAs can permanently lock those funds. The application address becomes inaccessible after deletion (unless it was rekeyed beforehand), and any minimum balance locked by boxes is lost forever.

Guard your `deleteApplication()` handler to ensure funds have been withdrawn first:

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
public deleteApplication(): void {
  assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Only creator can delete");
  assert(
    Global.currentApplicationAddress.balance === Global.currentApplicationAddress.minBalance,
    "Drain funds before deleting",

        == Global.current_application_address.min_balance
    ), "Drain funds before deleting"
```

### Pattern: Role-Based Access Control

For complex protocols, a single creator check is insufficient. Use a role-based pattern with a `BoxMap` to manage multiple admin roles (inspired by the [Folks Finance AccessControl pattern](https://github.com/Folks-Finance/algorand-smart-contract-library)).

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
import type { uint64, bytes } from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";
import {
  Account,
  Contract,
  BoxMap,
  Txn,
  Global,
  assert,
  Uint64,
  Bytes,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

const ROLE_ADMIN = Bytes("admin");
const ROLE_OPERATOR = Bytes("operator");

export class RoleBasedContract extends Contract {
  // BoxMap keyed by role+address, value is 1 (has role) or absent
  roles = BoxMap<bytes, uint64>({ keyPrefix: "role" });

  public createApplication(): void {
    // Creator is implicitly admin — box storage requires MBR
    // which isn't available at creation time, so we check
    // Global.creatorAddress in hasRole instead.
  }

  private hasRole(role: bytes, account: Account): boolean {
    // Creator always has admin role
    if (role === ROLE_ADMIN && account === Global.creatorAddress) {
      return true;
    }
    const key = role.concat(account.bytes);
    return this.roles(key).exists;
  }

  private requireRole(role: bytes): void {
    assert(this.hasRole(role, Txn.sender), "Missing required role");
  }

  public grantRole(role: bytes, account: Account): void {
    this.requireRole(ROLE_ADMIN);
    this.roles(role.concat(account.bytes)).value = Uint64(1);
  }

  public revokeRole(role: bytes, account: Account): void {
    this.requireRole(ROLE_ADMIN);
    const key = role.concat(account.bytes);
    if (this.roles(key).exists) {
      this.roles(key).delete();
    }
  }

  public performOperation(): void {
    this.requireRole(ROLE_OPERATOR);
  }

  public updateApplication(): void {
    this.requireRole(ROLE_ADMIN);
  }

  public deleteApplication(): void {
    this.requireRole(ROLE_ADMIN);
  }
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, BoxMap, Txn, arc4, Bytes, UInt64, Account, subroutine

ROLE_ADMIN = b"admin"
ROLE_OPERATOR = b"operator"

class RoleBasedContract(ARC4Contract):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # BoxMap keyed by role+address, value is 1 (has role) or absent
        self.roles = BoxMap(Bytes, UInt64, key_prefix=b"role")

    @arc4.baremethod(create="require")
    def create(self) -> None:
        # Grant creator the admin role on deploy
        self.roles[Bytes(ROLE_ADMIN) + Txn.sender.bytes] = UInt64(1)

    @subroutine
    def _has_role(self, role: Bytes, account: Account) -> bool:
        return Bytes(role) + account.bytes in self.roles

    @subroutine
    def _require_role(self, role: Bytes) -> None:
        assert self._has_role(role, Txn.sender), "Missing required role"

    @arc4.abimethod
    def grant_role(self, role: Bytes, account: Account) -> None:
        self._require_role(Bytes(ROLE_ADMIN))
        self.roles[Bytes(role) + account.bytes] = UInt64(1)

    @arc4.abimethod

        self._require_role(Bytes(ROLE_ADMIN))

    @arc4.abimethod(allow_actions=["DeleteApplication"])
    def delete(self) -> None:
        self._require_role(Bytes(ROLE_ADMIN))
```

### Key Takeaways

- PuyaTs/PuyaPy reject update and delete by default. Contracts are immutable and permanent unless you explicitly define handlers.
- If you define `updateApplication()` or `deleteApplication()`, always add access control (at minimum, a creator check).
- Guard deletion: ensure the application account's funds have been withdrawn before allowing `deleteApplication()`, otherwise ALGO and ASAs can be permanently locked.
- Start with creator-only checks. Graduate to role-based access when your protocol requires multiple admins or operators.
- Use `BoxMap` for role storage. It doesn't require user opt-in and persists until explicitly deleted.

---

## 3. Fee Management

### Risk

The AVM allows **fee pooling**: the total fee across all transactions in a group is shared. If a smart contract executes inner transactions without setting `fee = 0`, a malicious caller can repeatedly invoke the method to drain the application account's ALGO balance through accumulated fees.

Algorand Python and Algorand TypeScript protect against this by defaulting inner transaction fees to `0`. The caller covers fees through fee pooling. Avoid overriding this: explicitly setting a non-zero fee (e.g., `fee: Global.minTxnFee`) bypasses the compiler's protection and reintroduces the vulnerability.

Never hard-code fee values like `1000` microALGO. If you need to reference the minimum fee (e.g., in a LogicSig fee bound), use `Global.minTxnFee`.

**Note:** In raw TEAL, the default inner transaction fee is set to the global minimum transaction fee. The fee must be manually set to `0`.

### DO: Bound LogicSig fees

If you must use a LogicSig, bound the fee with `Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee` to prevent the account from being drained through excessive fees. This applies to both modes: in **Contract Account** mode, excessive fees drain the escrow; in **Delegated** mode, they drain the delegator's personal account.

A LogicSig that checks everything _except_ the fee is still vulnerable. An attacker submits valid transactions with inflated fees to siphon ALGO. See the [LogicSig Security Checklist](#do-follow-the-logicsig-security-checklist) in section 1 for the full list of required checks.

### Vulnerable: LogicSig without fee bound

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import {
  LogicSig,
  Txn,
  Global,
  Uint64,
  TransactionType,
  TemplateVar,
  Account,
  type bytes,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

// VULNERABLE: Checks everything except fee — allows fee draining
class UnboundedFeeSig extends LogicSig {
  public program(): boolean {
    return (
      Txn.typeEnum === TransactionType.Payment &&
      Txn.amount <= Uint64(1_000_000) &&
      // No fee check — attacker can set arbitrarily high fees
      Txn.receiver === TemplateVar<Account>("INTENDED_RECEIVER") &&
      Txn.rekeyTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.closeRemainderTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.lease === TemplateVar<bytes>("LEASE")
    );
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — VULNERABLE

```python
from algopy import logicsig, Txn, Global, UInt64, Bytes, TransactionType, TemplateVar, Account

# VULNERABLE: Checks everything except fee — allows fee draining
@logicsig
def unbounded_fee_sig() -> bool:
    return (
        Txn.type_enum == TransactionType.Payment
        and Txn.amount <= UInt64(1_000_000)
        # No fee check — attacker can set arbitrarily high fees
        and Txn.receiver == TemplateVar[Account]("INTENDED_RECEIVER")
        and Txn.rekey_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.close_remainder_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.lease == TemplateVar[Bytes]("LEASE")
    )
```

### Fixed: LogicSig with fee bound

Algorand TypeScript — SAFE

```typescript
import {
  LogicSig,
  Txn,
  Global,
  Uint64,
  TransactionType,
  TemplateVar,
  Account,
  type bytes,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

// SAFE: All checks including fee bound
class BoundedFeeSig extends LogicSig {
  public program(): boolean {
    return (
      Txn.typeEnum === TransactionType.Payment &&
      Txn.amount <= Uint64(1_000_000) &&
      Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee && // Added: caps fee to prevent draining
      Txn.receiver === TemplateVar<Account>("INTENDED_RECEIVER") &&
      Txn.rekeyTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.closeRemainderTo === Global.zeroAddress &&
      Txn.lease === TemplateVar<bytes>("LEASE")
    );
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — SAFE

```python
from algopy import logicsig, Txn, Global, UInt64, Bytes, TransactionType, TemplateVar, Account

# SAFE: All checks including fee bound
@logicsig
def bounded_fee_sig() -> bool:
    return (
        Txn.type_enum == TransactionType.Payment
        and Txn.amount <= UInt64(1_000_000)
        and Txn.fee <= Global.min_txn_fee  # Added: caps fee to prevent draining
        and Txn.receiver == TemplateVar[Account]("INTENDED_RECEIVER")
        and Txn.rekey_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.close_remainder_to == Global.zero_address
        and Txn.lease == TemplateVar[Bytes]("LEASE")
    )
```

### DO: Handle network congestion

During network congestion, the minimum fee may not be sufficient for timely inclusion. Off-chain code should:

- Monitor the suggested fee from the algod node (`/v2/transactions/params`)
- Set a maximum acceptable fee multiplier (e.g., 10x the minimum)
- Use exponential backoff for retries rather than continuously increasing fees

### Key Takeaways

- Inner transaction fees default to `0` in PuyaTs/PuyaPy. Don't override this with a non-zero fee.
- Use `Global.minTxnFee` when referencing the fee. Never hard-code `1000`.
- Bound `Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee` in LogicSigs to prevent fee draining.
- Callers must include enough fee to cover all inner transactions via fee pooling.

## 4. Transaction & Input Validation

### Risk

Smart contracts receive transactions from untrusted callers. Every field — asset ID, receiver, amount, type, and OnComplete action — must be validated. Missing checks can lead to fund theft, asset substitution, or bypassing of business logic.

### Unchecked Asset ID

If a contract accepts an asset transfer without verifying the asset ID, an attacker can substitute a worthless token for a valuable one.

### Vulnerable: Unchecked asset ID

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  gtxn,
  Global,
  Uint64,
  assert,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

export class VulnerableAssetContract extends Contract {
  // VULNERABLE: Does not verify which asset is being transferred
  public deposit(): void {
    assert(Global.groupSize === Uint64(2));
    const assetXfer = gtxn.AssetTransferTxn(Uint64(0));
    assert(
      assetXfer.assetReceiver === Global.currentApplicationAddress,
      "Must send to app",
    );
    // Missing: assert(assetXfer.xferAsset === expectedAsset)
    // Attacker can send any worthless ASA instead of the expected token
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — VULNERABLE

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, gtxn, Global, UInt64, arc4

class VulnerableAssetContract(ARC4Contract):
    # VULNERABLE: Does not verify which asset is being transferred
    @arc4.abimethod
    def deposit(self) -> None:
        assert Global.group_size == 2
        asset_xfer = gtxn.AssetTransferTransaction(0)
        assert (
            asset_xfer.asset_receiver == Global.current_application_address
        ), "Must send to app"
        # Missing: assert asset_xfer.xfer_asset == expected_asset
        # Attacker can send any worthless ASA instead of the expected token
```

### Fixed: Asset ID validation with typed ABI parameter

Instead of manually indexing into the group transaction array, accept the asset transfer as a **typed ABI method parameter**. The ARC-4 router automatically resolves the correct transaction reference, eliminating index errors and making the validation explicit:

Algorand TypeScript — SAFE

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Global,
  Txn,
  Asset,
  assert,
  Uint64,
  GlobalState,
  gtxn,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

export class SecureDepositContract extends Contract {
  acceptedAsset = GlobalState<Asset>({ key: "asset" });

  public setAsset(asset: Asset): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Only creator can set asset");
    this.acceptedAsset.value = asset;
  }

  // Accept the payment as a typed ABI parameter
  public deposit(payment: gtxn.AssetTransferTxn): void {
    assert(
      payment.assetReceiver === Global.currentApplicationAddress,
      "Must send to app",
    );
    assert(payment.xferAsset.id === this.acceptedAsset.value.id, "Wrong asset");
    assert(payment.assetAmount > Uint64(0), "Must send nonzero amount");
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — SAFE

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, gtxn, Global, Asset, Txn, arc4

class SecureDepositContract(ARC4Contract):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.accepted_asset = Asset()

    @arc4.abimethod
    def set_asset(self, asset: Asset) -> None:
        assert Txn.sender == Global.creator_address, "Only creator can set asset"
        self.accepted_asset = asset

    # Accept the payment as a typed ABI parameter
    @arc4.abimethod
    def deposit(self, payment: gtxn.AssetTransferTransaction) -> None:
        assert (
            payment.asset_receiver == Global.current_application_address
        ), "Must send to app"
        assert payment.xfer_asset.id == self.accepted_asset.id, "Wrong asset"
        assert payment.asset_amount > 0, "Must send nonzero amount"
```

### ARC-4 Input Validation

The **Puya** (Python) and **PuyaTs** (TypeScript) compilers automatically validate [ARC-4](https://dev.algorand.co/arc-standards/arc-0004/) encoding for ABI method arguments by default, but this only checks that the encoding is well-formed. For dynamic types like `string` and `byte[]`, it confirms the length prefix matches the data but does **not** enforce maximum lengths or other application-level constraints. You should still validate dynamic inputs in your contract logic to prevent oversized inputs from consuming opcode budget or storage.

> **Note:** If you disable per-method validation via `validate_encoding="unsafe_disabled"`, you must validate inputs manually.

If you are writing **raw TEAL**, you must manually validate all ABI-decoded inputs. See [Validating ABI Values](https://dev.algorand.co/concepts/smart-contracts/abi/#validating-abi-values) for details.

### DO: Validate dynamic input lengths

Even with Puya's automatic encoding validation, dynamic types like `string` and `DynamicBytes` can be arbitrarily long. Always assert application-level length constraints.

Algorand TypeScript — SAFE

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  assert,
  Uint64,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";
import {
  abimethod,
  Str,
  DynamicBytes,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript/arc4";

const MAX_NAME_BYTES = 64;

class ProfileContract extends Contract {
  @abimethod()
  public setName(name: Str): void {
    // Compiler validates ABI encoding, but we must enforce our own length limit
    assert(name.native.length <= Uint64(MAX_NAME_BYTES), "Name too long");
    // ... store name
  }

  @abimethod()
  public submitData(data: DynamicBytes): void {
    assert(data.length <= Uint64(256), "Data exceeds maximum size");
    // ... process data
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — SAFE

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, arc4, String

MAX_NAME_BYTES = 64

class ProfileContract(ARC4Contract):
    @arc4.abimethod
    def set_name(self, name: arc4.String) -> None:
        # Compiler validates ABI encoding, but we must enforce our own length limit
        assert name.native.bytes.length <= MAX_NAME_BYTES, "Name too long"
        # ... store name

    @arc4.abimethod
    def submit_data(self, data: arc4.DynamicBytes) -> None:
        assert data.length <= MAX_NAME_BYTES, "Data exceeds maximum size"
        # ... process data
```

### Key Takeaways

- Always check `xferAsset` when receiving asset transfers.
- Prefer typed ABI method parameters (`gtxn.PaymentTxn`, `gtxn.AssetTransferTxn`) over raw group indexes.
- Validate receiver, amount, and type on every transaction you consume.
- Keep your Puya compiler updated: check the [security bulletins](https://dev.algorand.co/bulletins/).
- Never trust clear state transactions as part of validation logic.

## 5. ASA Configuration Security

### Risk

When creating or reconfiguring an [Algorand Standard Asset (ASA)](https://dev.algorand.co/concepts/assets/overview/), four control addresses govern critical capabilities: **manager** (can change all addresses and destroy the asset), **clawback** (can revoke assets from any holder), **freeze** (can freeze any holder's balance), and **reserve** (indicates non-circulating supply; used by [ARC-19](https://dev.algorand.co/arc-standards/arc-0019/) for metadata resolution). Misconfiguring these can lead to permanent loss of control or unauthorized asset seizure.

Setting any control address to empty **permanently and irreversibly** disables that capability. There is no way to restore it. If the manager address is compromised, an attacker gains full reconfiguration power, including granting themselves freeze and clawback.

The most dangerous mistake is during **reconfiguration**: an asset config transaction must re-specify **all** existing addresses you want to keep. Any address field omitted from the transaction is permanently cleared. For example, if you only set `manager` in a config transaction, the `freeze`, `clawback`, and `reserve` addresses are all permanently removed, even if they were previously set.

### DON'T: Reconfigure ASAs without preserving all control addresses

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Global,
  itxn,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";
import { abimethod } from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript/arc4";

class VulnerableAssetManager extends Contract {
  @abimethod()
  public transferManagement(asset: Asset, newManager: Account): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Only creator");

    // VULNERABLE: Only sets manager — freeze, clawback, and reserve
    // are permanently cleared because they were omitted
    itxn
      .assetConfig({
        configAsset: asset,
        manager: newManager,
        fee: 0,
      })
      .submit();
  }
}
```

        # are permanently cleared because they were omitted
        itxn.AssetConfig(
            config_asset=asset,
            manager=new_manager,

        # SAFE: Re-specify ALL addresses — only change what you intend to
        itxn.AssetConfig(
            config_asset=asset,
            manager=new_manager,
            reserve=asset.reserve,
            freeze=asset.freeze,
            clawback=asset.clawback,
            fee=0,
        ).submit()
```

### Pattern: Safe ASA creation with explicit address configuration

When creating an ASA via inner transaction, always explicitly set the control addresses appropriate for your use case. Omitting them silently leaves them unset (empty), which is permanent.

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Global,
  itxn,
  uint64,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";
import { abimethod } from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript/arc4";

class TokenFactory extends Contract {
  @abimethod()
  public createImmutableToken(): uint64 {
    const result = itxn
      .assetConfig({
        total: 1_000_000_000,
        decimals: 6,
        unitName: "TKN",
        assetName: "My DeFi Token",
        // Manager intentionally omitted — asset is immutable from creation
        // Freeze intentionally omitted — no one can freeze holdings
        // Clawback intentionally omitted — no one can revoke holdings
        reserve: Global.currentApplicationAddress,
        fee: 0,
      })
      .submit();

    return result.createdAsset.id;
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — SAFE

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, Global, UInt64, itxn, arc4

class TokenFactory(ARC4Contract):
    @arc4.abimethod
    def create_immutable_token(self) -> UInt64:
        result = itxn.AssetConfig(
            total=1_000_000_000,
            decimals=6,
            unit_name=b"TKN",
            asset_name=b"My DeFi Token",
            # Manager intentionally omitted — asset is immutable from creation
            # Freeze intentionally omitted — no one can freeze holdings
            # Clawback intentionally omitted — no one can revoke holdings
            reserve=Global.current_application_address,
            fee=0,
        ).submit()

        return result.created_asset.id
```

> **Runnable examples:** [Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/5-asa-config-security/asa-reconfig-pitfall.e2e.spec.ts)

### Key Takeaways

- Explicitly set ASA control addresses for your use case. Omitting an address in a config transaction permanently clears it.
- Understand the role of each control address (manager, freeze, clawback, reserve) and remove those not needed.
- Reconfiguration transactions must re-specify all addresses you want to keep. Omitted fields are permanently cleared.

## 6. Rekeying & Account Draining

### Risk

Three transaction fields can permanently compromise an account in a single transaction:

| Field              | Effect                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RekeyTo`          | Transfers signing authority to another account. The original private key can no longer authorize transactions. |
| `CloseRemainderTo` | Sends **all remaining ALGO** to the specified address and closes the account.                                  |
| `AssetCloseTo`     | Sends **all remaining units** of an asset to the specified address and removes the opt-in.                     |

LogicSigs are especially vulnerable because they rely entirely on field checks to approve or reject transactions. If you forget to check one of these fields, nothing else stops it, and the program cannot be patched after deployment. The impact differs by mode: in **Contract Account** mode, rekeying transfers control of the escrow address; in **Delegated** mode, it transfers the delegator's personal account. Similarly, `CloseRemainderTo` drains either the escrow or the delegator's full ALGO balance. 

Smart contracts are safer by default since inner transaction fields like `closeRemainderTo` and `rekeyTo` are omitted unless explicitly set, but must still guard against exposing these fields to user-controlled inputs.

### Rekeying Attack

If a LogicSig does not check `RekeyTo`, an attacker submits a transaction that passes all other checks but includes `RekeyTo` set to the attacker's address. After one successful transaction, the attacker permanently controls the account, whether that's a Contract Account escrow or a delegator's personal account.

### Vulnerable: LogicSig missing RekeyTo check

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import {
  LogicSig,
  Txn,
  Global,

} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

// VULNERABLE: Missing RekeyTo check

      Txn.amount <= Uint64(500_000) &&
      Txn.fee <= Global.minTxnFee
    );
    // Missing: && Txn.rekeyTo === Global.zeroAddress
  }
}
```

        and Txn.amount <= UInt64(500_000)
        and Txn.fee <= Global.min_txn_fee
        # Missing: and Txn.rekey_to == Global.zero_address

      Txn.rekeyTo === Global.zeroAddress && // Prevent rekeying
      Txn.closeRemainderTo === Global.zeroAddress // Prevent draining

        and Txn.fee <= Global.min_txn_fee
        and Txn.rekey_to == Global.zero_address          # Prevent rekeying
        and Txn.close_remainder_to == Global.zero_address # Prevent draining
    )
```

### Account Closing Attack

The same logic applies to `CloseRemainderTo` (drains all ALGO) and `AssetCloseTo` (drains all units of a specific asset). In **Contract Account** mode, this drains the escrow. In **Delegated** mode, this drains the delegator's personal account.

Smart contracts face the same risk: if your contract constructs inner transactions with user-controlled fields, never let users specify `rekeyTo`, `closeRemainderTo`, or `assetCloseTo` on those inner transactions.

### Vulnerable: Inner transaction with user-controlled close field

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
// VULNERABLE: User-controlled close field on inner transaction
public unsafeTransfer(receiver: Account, closeTo: Account): void {
  itxn.payment({
    receiver: receiver,
    amount: Uint64(0),
    closeRemainderTo: closeTo, // Attacker drains the app account!
    fee: Uint64(0),
  }).submit()
}
```

Algorand Python — VULNERABLE

```python
# VULNERABLE: User-controlled close field on inner transaction
@arc4.abimethod
def unsafe_transfer(self, receiver: Account, close_to: Account) -> None:
    itxn.Payment(
        receiver=receiver,
        amount=0,
        close_remainder_to=close_to,  # Attacker drains the app account!
        fee=0,
    ).submit()
```

### Fixed: Inner transaction that never exposes close/rekey fields

Algorand TypeScript — SAFE

```typescript
// SAFE: Never expose close/rekey fields to callers
public safeTransfer(receiver: Account, amount: uint64): void {
  itxn.payment({
    receiver: receiver,
    amount: amount,
    fee: Uint64(0),
    // closeRemainderTo and rekeyTo are intentionally omitted
  }).submit()
}
```

Algorand Python — SAFE

# SAFE: Never expose close/rekey fields to callers
@arc4.abimethod
def safe_transfer(self, receiver: Account, amount: UInt64) -> None:
    itxn.Payment(
        receiver=receiver,
        amount=amount,
        fee=0,
        # close_remainder_to and rekey_to are intentionally omitted
    ).submit()
```

### Application Account Rekeying

Avoid rekeying the application account to an externally-owned address. If that key is compromised, the attacker bypasses all contract logic and can drain funds directly without calling any contract method. If rekeying is necessary (e.g., for migration), use a multisig or another contract address.

### Key Takeaways

- **Every LogicSig** must check `RekeyTo == ZeroAddress`, `CloseRemainderTo == ZeroAddress`, and `AssetCloseTo == ZeroAddress`.
- **Smart contracts** must never let callers control `rekeyTo`, `closeRemainderTo`, or `assetCloseTo` on inner transactions.
- Avoid rekeying the application account to an externally-owned address. Use a multisig or contract address if rekeying is needed.

## 7. Group Transaction Security

### Risk

Algorand supports atomic groups of up to 16 transactions. Flawed group validation can lead to double-counting payments or bypassing access controls.

### Group Size Enforcement vs Composability

Requiring an exact group size (e.g., `assert(Global.groupSize === Uint64(2))`) prevents composability. Other contracts or dApps cannot wrap your transactions in larger groups. However, _not_ checking group size can allow an attacker to pad a group with duplicate application calls, causing your contract to execute multiple times for a single payment.

### Vulnerable: No group size check, counting payment by index

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  GlobalState,
  gtxn,
  Global,
  Uint64,
  assert,
  type uint64,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

export class VulnerableGroupContract extends Contract {
  totalCredits = GlobalState<uint64>({ key: "credits" });

  public createApplication(): void {
    this.totalCredits.value = 0;
  }

  // VULNERABLE: Attacker can pad the group with extra app calls
  // to execute this method multiple times for one payment
  public buyCredit(): void {
    const payment = gtxn.PaymentTxn(Uint64(0)); // Always reads index 0
    assert(
      payment.receiver === Global.currentApplicationAddress,
      "Must pay app",
    );
    // Each app call in the group reads the same payment at index 0
    // Result: attacker gets N credits for 1 payment
    this.totalCredits.value = this.totalCredits.value + Uint64(1);
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — VULNERABLE

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, GlobalState, gtxn, Global, UInt64, arc4

class VulnerableGroupContract(ARC4Contract):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.total_credits = UInt64(0)

    # VULNERABLE: Attacker can pad the group with extra app calls
    # to execute this method multiple times for one payment
    @arc4.abimethod
    def buy_credit(self) -> None:
        payment = gtxn.PaymentTransaction(0)  # Always reads index 0
        assert (
            payment.receiver == Global.current_application_address
        ), "Must pay app"
        # Each app call in the group reads the same payment at index 0
        # Result: attacker gets N credits for 1 payment
        self.total_credits += UInt64(1)
```

### Fixed: Use relative indexing via ABI parameters

import {
  Contract,
  GlobalState,

  gtxn,
  type uint64,

      payment.receiver === Global.currentApplicationAddress,
      "Must pay app",
    );
    assert(payment.amount >= Uint64(1_000_000), "Insufficient payment");
    // Each app call requires its own paired payment — no double-counting
    this.totalCredits.value = this.totalCredits.value + Uint64(1);
  }
}
```

### DO: Implement rate limiting for flash-loan risk

On Algorand, flash-loan-style attacks happen within a single atomic transaction group. An attacker can borrow funds, manipulate contract state (e.g., skew a price oracle or drain a liquidity pool), and repay, all atomically. If any step fails, the entire group reverts, making the attack risk-free for the attacker. Because Algorand groups can contain up to 16 transactions, a single group provides enough room to execute complex multi-step exploits.

Rate limiting mitigates this by capping how much value can flow through a contract within a time period, limiting the blast radius of any single exploit and buying time for detection and response.

The [Folks Finance RateLimiter](https://github.com/Folks-Finance/algorand-smart-contract-library/blob/main/folks_contracts/library/RateLimiter.py) provides a reference implementation using a **token bucket algorithm** with box storage. Each bucket has a capacity limit and a duration. Capacity refills linearly over time and is consumed by each action. If insufficient capacity remains, the transaction is rejected.

### Key Takeaways

- Use ABI method parameters for group transaction references instead of hard-coded indexes.
- Implement rate limiting for contracts exposed to flash-loan risk.

## 8. State Management & Storage Security

### Risk

Local state, global state, and box storage each have unique security properties. Misunderstanding these properties leads to lost funds, denial of service, or bricked contracts.

A user can **always** clear their local state by sending a `ClearState` transaction. The clear state program runs, but even if it fails, the local state is deleted. This means critical protocol data stored in local state can be destroyed unilaterally. If a user clears their local state to avoid a penalty (e.g., liquidation), the protocol has no recourse. Use boxes (`BoxMap`) for user-associated data that must persist regardless of user action.

### Vulnerable: Loan contract storing debt in local state

If a contract stores a user's debt or collateral in `LocalState`, the user can send a `ClearState` transaction to erase it, escaping liquidation, penalties, or repayment obligations.

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Txn,
  LocalState,
  Uint64,
  assert,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

// VULNERABLE: User can clear local state to erase their debt
export class VulnerableLoanContract extends Contract {
  debt = LocalState<uint64>({ key: "debt" });
  collateral = LocalState<uint64>({ key: "col" });

  public optInToApplication(): void {
    this.debt(Txn.sender).value = Uint64(0);
    this.collateral(Txn.sender).value = Uint64(0);
  }

  public borrow(amount: uint64): void {
    // ... transfer funds to user
    this.debt(Txn.sender).value = this.debt(Txn.sender).value + amount;
  }

  public liquidate(user: Account): void {
    // User can dodge this by clearing local state first
    assert(this.debt(user).value > this.collateral(user).value, "Not undercollateralized");
    // ... seize collateral
  }
}
```

Algorand Python — VULNERABLE

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, Txn, LocalState, UInt64, arc4, Account

# VULNERABLE: User can clear local state to erase their debt
class VulnerableLoanContract(ARC4Contract):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.debt = LocalState(UInt64, key="debt")
        self.collateral = LocalState(UInt64, key="col")

    @arc4.abimethod(allow_actions=["OptIn"])
    def opt_in(self) -> None:
        self.debt[Txn.sender] = UInt64(0)
        self.collateral[Txn.sender] = UInt64(0)

    @arc4.abimethod
    def borrow(self, amount: UInt64) -> None:
        # ... transfer funds to user
        self.debt[Txn.sender] += amount

    def liquidate(self, user: Account) -> None:
        # User can dodge this by clearing local state first
        assert self.debt[user] > self.collateral[user], "Not undercollateralized"
        # ... seize collateral

The clear state program should still handle cleanup gracefully. See below.

### DO: Handle clear state gracefully

When a user clears their local state, any value the contract was tracking for them (e.g., a deposited balance) becomes orphaned. The funds are still in the contract's account, but the record of ownership is gone. A well-written clear state program accounts for this by recording what was lost, so the contract admin can reconcile or redistribute those funds later.

Keep in mind: the clear state program **cannot** access boxes (all box-related opcodes fail immediately in a clear state context). Foreign accounts, apps, and assets are not strictly prohibited, but the caller is under no obligation to supply them, so relying on their availability is unsafe. If the clear state program fails for any reason, the user's local state is still deleted and the transaction still succeeds. A failing clear state program wastes resources and is functionally equivalent to an empty one.

### Pattern: Handle clear state by tracking cleared values

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Txn,
  GlobalState,
  LocalState,
  Uint64,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

export class SafeClearContract extends Contract {
  userBalance = LocalState<uint64>({ key: "bal" });
  unclaimedFunds = GlobalState<uint64>({ key: "unclaimed" });

  public createApplication(): void {
    this.unclaimedFunds.value = Uint64(0);
  }

  public optInToApplication(): void {
    this.userBalance(Txn.sender).value = Uint64(0);
  }

  // The clear state program handles early exit
  clearStateProgram(): boolean {
    // Track unclaimed funds in global state (accessible during clear)
    const balance = this.userBalance(Txn.sender).value;
    this.unclaimedFunds.value = this.unclaimedFunds.value + balance;
    return true; // Always approve
  }
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
from algopy import Contract, Txn, UInt64

class SafeClearContract(Contract):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.unclaimed_funds = UInt64(0)

    def approval_program(self) -> UInt64:
        # ... approval logic
        return UInt64(1)

    def clear_state_program(self) -> UInt64:
        # Track unclaimed funds in global state
        # Note: cannot access boxes or foreign refs here
        self.unclaimed_funds += self.user_balance[Txn.sender]
        return UInt64(1)  # Always approve
```

### DO: Use pull-based withdrawals instead of push-based distribution

When distributing funds to multiple users, prefer letting each user withdraw their own funds ("pull") rather than sending to all users in a single call ("push"). Batching inner payments in one app call means a single failed transfer rolls back the entire group, and individual failures are easier to handle when each user triggers their own withdrawal.

### Vulnerable: Push-based distribution

Algorand TypeScript — VULNERABLE

```typescript
// VULNERABLE: If any inner payment fails, the entire
// call reverts — blocking all other recipients
public distribute(recipients: Account[]): void {
  for (const recipient of recipients) {
    const balance = this.userBalance(recipient).value
    itxn.payment({
      receiver: recipient,
      amount: balance,
      fee: Uint64(0),
    }).submit()
  }
}
```

# VULNERABLE: If any inner payment fails, the entire
# call reverts — blocking all other recipients

        balance = self.user_balance[recipient]

            receiver=recipient,

### DON'T: Delete a contract with boxes still allocated

Before deleting a contract, **all boxes must be deleted first**. Boxes hold MBR (Minimum Balance Requirement) that is locked in the application account. If boxes remain when the contract is deleted, that MBR is unrecoverable.

### DON'T: Hard-code minimum balance values

The contract account's minimum balance depends on opted-in assets, created apps, local state schemas, and boxes. Hard-coding a value means the contract will break if any of these change. For example, it will break after creating a new box or opting into an asset.

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
// Hard-coded minimum balance breaks when the contract
// opts into assets, creates boxes, or adds local state schemas
public withdraw(amount: uint64): void {
  const app = Global.currentApplicationAddress;
  assert(app.balance - Uint64(100_000) >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance");
  // ... send inner payment
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
# Hard-coded minimum balance breaks when the contract
# opts into assets, creates boxes, or adds local state schemas
@arc4.abimethod
def withdraw(self, amount: UInt64) -> None:
    app = Global.current_application_address
    assert app.balance - UInt64(100_000) >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance"
    # ... send inner payment
```

### DO: Use dynamic minimum balance checks

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
// Uses the AVM's min_balance opcode to calculate spendable balance dynamically
public withdraw(amount: uint64): void {
  const app = Global.currentApplicationAddress;
  assert(app.balance - app.minBalance >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance");
  // ... send inner payment
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
# Uses the AVM's min_balance opcode to calculate spendable balance dynamically
@arc4.abimethod
def withdraw(self, amount: UInt64) -> None:
    app = Global.current_application_address
    assert app.balance - app.min_balance >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance"
    # ... send inner payment
```

### Key Takeaways

- Use `BoxMap` instead of `LocalState` for data that must persist regardless of user action.
- Clear state programs must never fail. Handle cleared state gracefully.
- Use the **pull pattern** (users withdraw their own funds) instead of the push pattern (contract distributes to users).
- Delete all boxes before deleting a contract.
- Never hard-code minimum balance values.

## 9. Arithmetic Safety

### Risk

The AVM uses **unsigned 64-bit integers** (`uint64`). Arithmetic operations can overflow (exceed 2^64 - 1) or underflow (go below 0), causing unexpected behavior or exploitable bugs.

### Overflow

On the AVM, `uint64` overflow causes the transaction to **fail** (the AVM panics on overflow rather than wrapping). This is safer than silent wrapping but can still be exploited to cause denial of service.

### DON'T: Leave addition unguarded against overflow

Unguarded addition can panic if the result exceeds `2^64 - 1`, which an attacker could use to block a critical operation.

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Uint64,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

export class UnguardedOverflowContract extends Contract {
  // Unguarded: If a + b overflows uint64, the transaction fails.
  // An attacker could trigger this to block a critical operation.
  public unsafeAdd(a: uint64, b: uint64): uint64 {
    return a + b; // Panics if result > 2^64 - 1
  }
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, arc4

class UnguardedOverflowContract(ARC4Contract):
    # Unguarded: If a + b overflows uint64, the transaction fails
    @arc4.abimethod
    def unsafe_add(self, a: arc4.UInt64, b: arc4.UInt64) -> arc4.UInt64:
        return arc4.UInt64(a.native + b.native)  # Panics on overflow
```

### DO: Check bounds before addition

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Uint64,
  assert,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

const MAX_UINT64: uint64 = Uint64(18_446_744_073_709_551_615n);

export class SafeOverflowContract extends Contract {
  public safeAdd(a: uint64, b: uint64): uint64 {
    assert(a <= MAX_UINT64 - b, "Overflow");
    return a + b;
  }
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, UInt64, arc4

class SafeOverflowContract(ARC4Contract):
    @arc4.abimethod
    def safe_add(self, a: arc4.UInt64, b: arc4.UInt64) -> arc4.UInt64:
        x = a.native
        y = b.native
        assert x <= UInt64(18_446_744_073_709_551_615) - y, "Overflow"
        return arc4.UInt64(x + y)
```

> **Runnable examples:** [Source](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/9-arithmetic-safety/contract.algo.ts) | [Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/9-arithmetic-safety/contract.e2e.spec.ts)

### Underflow

Subtracting a larger value from a smaller one panics on the AVM. Always check ordering before subtraction.

### DON'T: Leave subtraction unguarded against underflow

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
// Panics if balance < amount
public unsafeWithdraw(amount: uint64): void {
  const balance = this.userBalance(Txn.sender).value;
  this.userBalance(Txn.sender).value = balance - amount; // Underflow!
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
# Panics if balance < amount
@arc4.abimethod
def unsafe_withdraw(self, amount: UInt64) -> None:
    balance = self.user_balance[Txn.sender]
    self.user_balance[Txn.sender] = balance - amount  # Underflow!
```

### DO: Check ordering before subtracting

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
public safeWithdraw(amount: uint64): void {
  const balance = this.userBalance(Txn.sender).value;
  assert(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
  this.userBalance(Txn.sender).value = balance - amount;
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
@arc4.abimethod
def safe_withdraw(self, amount: UInt64) -> None:
    balance = self.user_balance[Txn.sender]
    assert balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance"
    self.user_balance[Txn.sender] = balance - amount
```

> **Runnable examples:** [Source](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/9-arithmetic-safety/contract.algo.ts) | [Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/9-arithmetic-safety/contract.e2e.spec.ts)

### DO: Use BigUInt for intermediate calculations

If your contract handles token amounts that could exceed 2^64 - 1 (e.g., multiplying two large `uint64` values for price calculations), use `biguint` (PuyaTS) / `BigUInt` (PuyaPy) for intermediate calculations.

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  BigUint,
  Uint64,
  Bytes,
  op,
  assert,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

export class BigUintContract extends Contract {
  // Safe multiplication that won't overflow
  public safeMultiplyDivide(a: uint64, b: uint64, denominator: uint64): uint64 {
    assert(denominator > Uint64(0), "Division by zero");
    const bigA = BigUint(a);
    const bigB = BigUint(b);
    const bigDenom = BigUint(denominator);
    const result = (bigA * bigB) / bigDenom;
    return op.btoi(Bytes(result));
  }
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, BigUInt, UInt64, arc4, subroutine

@subroutine
def safe_multiply_divide(a: UInt64, b: UInt64, denominator: UInt64) -> UInt64:
    big_a = BigUInt(a)
    big_b = BigUInt(b)
    big_denom = BigUInt(denominator)
    result = (big_a * big_b) // big_denom
    # Convert back to UInt64 — will panic if result doesn't fit
    return UInt64.from_bytes(result.bytes[-8:])
```

> **Runnable examples:** [Source](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/9-arithmetic-safety/contract.algo.ts) | [Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/9-arithmetic-safety/contract.e2e.spec.ts)

### DO: Perform invariant analysis on arithmetic-heavy contracts

For any arithmetic-heavy contract (DEX, lending, staking), perform **semi-formal invariant analysis**:

1. **Identify invariants**: What must always be true? (e.g., `sum(all_balances) == total_supply`)
2. **Trace each operation**: Does deposit/withdraw/swap preserve the invariant?
3. **Check edge cases**: Zero amounts, maximum values, single-unit remainders.
4. **Test with boundary values**: `0`, `1`, `2^64 - 1`, `2^64 - 2`.

### Key Takeaways

- The AVM panics on overflow/underflow: safer than wrapping, but can still cause DoS.
- Always check ordering before subtraction.
- Use `biguint`/`BigUInt` for intermediate calculations that could exceed `uint64` range.
- Perform invariant analysis on any contract with nontrivial arithmetic.

## 10. Updatability & Deletability

### Risk

An updatable contract can have its approval program replaced, meaning the contract creator (or anyone with update authority) can change the rules after deployment. This is a significant trust assumption for users. Conversely, a fully immutable contract cannot be patched if a vulnerability is discovered.

### DO: Choose an appropriate upgrade strategy and document it

An `UpdateApplication` transaction replaces the approval and clear state programs entirely. The current program runs first and can reject the update, so guardrails like timelocks or multisig checks are enforced. But once approved, the new program replaces everything, including those guardrails. Note: programs on AVM version 4+ [cannot be downgraded](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/specs/blob/master/_archive/dev/ledger.md).

**Immutable contracts**: Don't define `updateApplication` or `deleteApplication` methods. Users can verify the rules cannot change, but vulnerabilities cannot be patched. For additional hardening, rekey the creator account to `Global.zeroAddress` after deployment (see [Section 12](#12-key-management--deployment)).

**Upgradeable contracts**: Allow patching and protocol evolution, but require users to trust whoever can satisfy the update conditions. An approved update can remove all prior restrictions.

Document your choice clearly so users can make informed trust decisions.

### Pattern: Upgradeable contract with timelock

A **timelock pattern** announces the upgrade in advance, waits a minimum delay, then applies it. The current program enforces the delay, giving users time to review and exit before the update takes effect. Once the update goes through, the new program could remove the timelock for future updates.

Inspired by the [Folks Finance Upgradeable pattern](https://github.com/Folks-Finance/algorand-smart-contract-library):

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Txn,
  Global,
  GlobalState,
  assert,
  Uint64,
  Bytes,
  op,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

const UPGRADE_DELAY = Uint64(86400); // 24 hours in seconds

export class UpgradeableContract extends Contract {
  upgradeHash = GlobalState<bytes>({ key: "uhash" }); // SHA-256 of new program
  upgradeTimestamp = GlobalState<uint64>({ key: "utime" }); // When upgrade was scheduled
  upgradeReady = GlobalState<uint64>({ key: "uready" }); // 1 if scheduled

  // Step 1: Schedule an upgrade (admin only)
  public scheduleUpgrade(programHash: bytes): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Admin only");
    this.upgradeHash.value = programHash;
    this.upgradeTimestamp.value = Global.latestTimestamp;
    this.upgradeReady.value = Uint64(1);
  }

  // Step 2: Apply the upgrade after delay
  public updateApplication(): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Admin only");
    assert(this.upgradeReady.value === Uint64(1), "No upgrade scheduled");

    // Enforce timelock
    const elapsed: uint64 =
      Global.latestTimestamp - this.upgradeTimestamp.value;
    assert(elapsed >= UPGRADE_DELAY, "Timelock not expired");

    // Verify the program matches the announced hash
    // (The actual program bytes are in the update transaction)

    // Clear the upgrade schedule
    this.upgradeReady.value = Uint64(0);
  }

  // Allow anyone to cancel (optional — or restrict to admin)
  public cancelUpgrade(): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Admin only");
    this.upgradeReady.value = Uint64(0);
  }
}
```

Algorand Python

```python
from algopy import ARC4Contract, Txn, Global, UInt64, Bytes, arc4, op

UPGRADE_DELAY = UInt64(86400)  # 24 hours in seconds

class UpgradeableContract(ARC4Contract):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.upgrade_hash = Bytes()       # SHA-256 of new program
        self.upgrade_timestamp = UInt64(0) # When upgrade was scheduled
        self.upgrade_ready = UInt64(0)     # 1 if scheduled

    # Step 1: Schedule an upgrade (admin only)
    @arc4.abimethod
    def schedule_upgrade(self, program_hash: Bytes) -> None:
        assert Txn.sender == self.creator, "Admin only"
        self.upgrade_hash = program_hash
        self.upgrade_timestamp = Global.latest_timestamp
        self.upgrade_ready = UInt64(1)

    # Step 2: Apply the upgrade after delay
    @arc4.abimethod(allow_actions=["UpdateApplication"])
    def update(self) -> None:
        assert Txn.sender == self.creator, "Admin only"
        assert self.upgrade_ready == UInt64(1), "No upgrade scheduled"

        # Enforce timelock
        elapsed = Global.latest_timestamp - self.upgrade_timestamp
        assert elapsed >= UPGRADE_DELAY, "Timelock not expired"

        # Clear the upgrade schedule
        self.upgrade_ready = UInt64(0)

    # Allow admin to cancel
    @arc4.abimethod
    def cancel_upgrade(self) -> None:
        assert Txn.sender == self.creator, "Admin only"
        self.upgrade_ready = UInt64(0)
```

> **Runnable examples:** [Source](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/10-updatability-deletability/contract.algo.ts) | [Tests](./smart-contract-examples/projects/smart-contract-examples/smart_contracts/10-updatability-deletability/contract.e2e.spec.ts)

### DON'T: Delete a funded contract

If a contract's application address holds ALGO or assets, deleting the contract makes those funds **unrecoverable**. Before deleting:

1. Withdraw all ALGO and assets from the application address.
2. Delete all boxes (to reclaim MBR).
3. Then delete the application.

### Key Takeaways

- Choose immutable or upgradeable: document the choice for users.
- If upgradeable, use a timelock with program hash pre-announcement.
- Never delete a contract that holds funds.
- For immutable contracts, consider rekeying the creator to zero address for provable immutability.

---

## 11. Randomness

### Risk

Smart contracts are fully deterministic and all on-chain data is public. Any value derived from block or transaction data is predictable, so contracts cannot generate their own randomness. The [Algorand VRF Randomness Beacon](https://dev.algorand.co/concepts/protocol/randomness/#algorand-randomness-beacon) solves this by providing verifiable pseudo-random values on-chain.

The beacon smart contract app IDs are: **TestNet:** `600011887` | **MainNet:** `1615566206`

### DO: Follow randomness beacon best practices

> **Warning:** Not following these best practices can lead to complete loss of funds.

The randomness beacon generates VRF proofs every 8 rounds and stores the last 189 outputs (covering 1,512 rounds). Smart contracts query it via two ABI methods:

- `get(uint64,byte[])byte[]`: returns a 32-byte pseudo-random value derived from the VRF output for the given round and optional user data. Returns an empty byte array if the value is not available.
- `must_get(uint64,byte[])byte[]`: same as `get`, but panics if the value is not available.

#### 1. Commit to a future round

Publicly commit to the round you'll use for randomness, several rounds in advance. Random values for past rounds are already public on-chain. Without commitment, a user can look at existing values and choose a round whose outcome is favorable. Commitment can be implicit (e.g., a lottery that always uses rounds that are multiples of 10,000) or explicit (logged or stored on-chain).

#### 2. Ensure a gap between the last input and the committed round

Stop accepting inputs (e.g., lottery bets) well before the committed round. The further in the future the committed round is, the less predictable the block seed will be.

#### 3. Read the random value at the right time

Values are only available after the VRF proof is submitted (typically within ~3 rounds of the next multiple-of-8 round, but delays are possible). They remain available for 1,512 rounds. After that, they're permanently inaccessible. If your app needs a longer window, a proxy contract or off-chain cache can store values beyond the beacon's limit.

#### 4. Handle beacon downtime gracefully

The beacon depends on an external service. If it's down for more than 1,000 rounds, some values will never be available on-chain. Contracts must not permanently lock funds if randomness is unavailable. Always provide an escape hatch. For example: backup rounds for short outages, participant withdrawal after a timeout, or a community vote to change the committed round.

#### 5. Plan for discontinuation

The beacon smart contract is immutable and tied to a specific VRF key. If the key is compromised or the service is discontinued, a new contract with a new key must be deployed. Use an updatable proxy contract between your app and the beacon, or ensure your contract can be updated to point to a new beacon app ID.

#### 6. Allow anyone to trigger the randomness call

If only the owner can call the method that reads the random value, the owner can refuse to call it, blocking distribution of assets when the outcome is not in their favor. Ensure any participant can submit the transaction.

### Pattern: Beacon stub for LocalNet testing

The real Randomness Beacon isn't available on LocalNet. Use a beacon stub that implements the same `get`/`must_get` interface with a controllable `set_next` method, so you can test your app's randomness logic with deterministic values.

```typescript
import { bytes, Bytes, Contract, GlobalState, arc4 } from '@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript'

export class BeaconStub extends Contract {
  next = GlobalState<bytes>({
    initialValue: Bytes.fromHex('0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'),
  })

  set_next(nextValue: bytes<32>) {
    this.next.value = nextValue
  }

  must_get(round: arc4.Uint64, user_data: arc4.DynamicBytes): arc4.DynamicBytes {
    return new arc4.DynamicBytes(this.next.value)
  }

  get(round: arc4.Uint64, user_data: arc4.DynamicBytes): arc4.DynamicBytes {
    return new arc4.DynamicBytes(this.next.value)
  }
}
```

### Key Takeaways

- Use the Algorand VRF Randomness Beacon for on-chain randomness.
- Commit to a future round and ensure a gap between last input and the committed round.
- Read random values within the 1,512-round availability window.
- Always provide an escape hatch for beacon downtime or discontinuation.
- Allow anyone to trigger the randomness call.

---

## 12. Oracles

### Risk

Smart contracts cannot access off-chain data directly. Oracles bridge this gap, but introduce trust assumptions that must be carefully managed.

### DO: Restrict and validate oracle data

If your contract depends on external data (prices, timestamps, weather), understand the trust model:

- **Who can submit oracle data?** Restrict to known oracle addresses.
- **How fresh must the data be?** Check timestamps and reject stale data.
- **What if the oracle goes offline?** Have a fallback or pause mechanism.
- **Can the oracle operator front-run?** Consider using multiple independent oracles.

### Key Takeaways

- Document and restrict oracle trust assumptions explicitly.

---

## 13. Key Management & Deployment

### Risk

The security of a smart contract ultimately depends on the security of the keys that control it. A compromised creator key means a compromised contract.

### DO: Use multisig for upgradeable contract creators

Never use a single-key account as the creator of a contract holding significant value. Use a **multisig account** (e.g., 2-of-3 or 3-of-5) instead, and store each signer's key in a separate physical location (hardware wallets). Rotate keys periodically.

#### Multisig gotchas

- **Address ordering matters:** A multisig created with addresses `[A, B, C]` produces a different multisig address than `[B, A, C]`. Document the canonical ordering to avoid confusion.
- **Threshold selection:** 1-of-N provides no security benefit over a single key. N-of-N risks permanent lockout if any signer loses their key. Use a majority threshold (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5).
- **No nesting:** Algorand does not support multisig-within-multisig.

### DO: Follow deployment best practices

- **Never store mnemonics or private keys in source code**, environment variables checked into version control, or configuration files.
- Use AlgoKit's environment-based account resolution (`AlgorandClient.fromEnvironment()`) and keep keys in secure vaults.
- The alpha release of [AlgoKit Utils TypeScript (v10)](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts) introduces **wrapped secrets**: an API that integrates with external secrets managers (e.g., AWS KMS, system keychains) by unwrapping signing keys on-demand rather than holding them in memory.
- Deploy to testnet first and run your full test suite before mainnet.
- Verify the deployed TEAL bytecode matches your compiled source.

### Key Takeaways

- Always use multisig for the creator account of contracts holding significant value.
- Document signer ordering and use a majority threshold: avoid 1-of-N or N-of-N.
- Never store keys in code or version-controlled config files.

---

## 14. Security Tooling & Audit

### DO: Integrate Tealer static analysis

[Tealer](https://github.com/crytic/tealer) is a static analysis tool for TEAL programs. It can detect common vulnerability patterns including missing access controls, unchecked group sizes, and fee issues.

**AlgoKit integration:**

```bash
# Run Tealer analysis on compiled TEAL
algokit task analyze <path-to-approval.teal>
```

**CI/CD integration example (GitHub Actions):**

```yaml
- name: Analyze smart contracts
  run: |
    algokit project run build
    algokit task analyze artifacts/approval.teal --reporter json > analysis.json
    # Fail the build if critical issues are found
    if jq -e '.[] | select(.severity == "critical")' analysis.json > /dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "Critical security issues found!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### DO: Pin and monitor your Puya compiler version

Like any compiler, Puya can have security-relevant bugs. Always:

- **Pin your compiler version** in your project configuration.
- **Monitor the [Algorand security bulletins](https://dev.algorand.co/bulletins/puya-issues-27-10-2025/)** for disclosures.
- **Update promptly** when security fixes are released.
- **Re-compile and re-deploy** if you were using an affected version.

### DO: Get a professional audit before mainnet

Before deploying a contract that will hold significant value, engage a professional audit firm with Algorand experience. Some firms that have audited Algorand contracts:

- [Runtime Verification](https://runtimeverification.com/)
- [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/)
- [Certik](https://www.certik.com/)
- [Halborn](https://www.halborn.com/)
- [Vantage Point Blockchain](https://www.vpblockchain.com/)

### DO: Use continuous security tooling during development

For teams that are not yet ready for a full audit, or want ongoing coverage between audits, AI-driven security tools can catch vulnerabilities during development. [Almanax](https://www.almanax.ai/) provides continuous security monitoring and vulnerability management with automated triage and one-click patches. The Algorand Foundation [partners with Almanax](https://www.almanax.ai/blog/almanax-partners-with-algorand-foundation) to provide these capabilities to participants in the Algorand Accelerator program.

### DO: Run a bug bounty program

If your protocol manages user funds, establish a bug bounty program. This creates a financial incentive for security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

### Key Takeaways

- Integrate Tealer static analysis into CI/CD.
- Pin and monitor your Puya compiler version.
- Get a professional audit before mainnet deployment with real value.
- Run a bug bounty program for protocols managing user funds.

---

## 15. Off-Chain & Operational Security

Smart contract security doesn't end at the TEAL bytecode. The off-chain infrastructure — APIs, frontends, deployment pipelines, and monitoring — is equally critical.

### DO: Run your own node for mission-critical applications

- **Your own node** is the most trustworthy source. Third-party API providers can censor, delay, or manipulate responses.
- **Indexer data** is eventually consistent. Don't rely on indexer queries for real-time transaction confirmation. Use algod's pending transaction endpoint.
- If using third-party APIs, understand their SLA and rate limits.

### DO: Apply OWASP best practices to your dApp

Your dApp frontend and backend are standard web applications. Apply the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/):

- Input validation and output encoding
- Authentication and session management
- CSRF protection
- Secure headers (CSP, HSTS)
- Dependency scanning and updates

### DO: Monitor on-chain activity and plan for incidents

- **Monitor application transactions** and alert on unexpected patterns:
  - `UpdateApplication` or `DeleteApplication` calls
  - Large or unusual fund movements
  - Rapid increase in transaction volume
- **Use [AlgoKit Subscriber](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-subscriber-ts) ([TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@algorandfoundation/algokit-subscriber) | [Python](https://pypi.org/project/algokit-subscriber/))** to subscribe to on-chain events and build real-time monitoring services.
- **Have an incident response plan**: who to contact, how to pause the contract (if a kill switch exists), and how to communicate with users.

### Pattern: Pausable contract with kill switch

For contracts managing significant value, consider a **pause mechanism** that allows an authorized account to halt all critical operations if an exploit is detected, giving you time to investigate and respond without further loss of funds:

Algorand TypeScript

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Txn,
  Global,
  GlobalState,
  assert,
  Uint64,
} from "@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript";

export class PausableContract extends Contract {
  paused = GlobalState<uint64>({ key: "paused" });

  public createApplication(): void {
    this.paused.value = Uint64(0); // Not paused
  }

  public pause(): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Admin only");
    this.paused.value = Uint64(1);
  }

  public unpause(): void {
    assert(Txn.sender === Global.creatorAddress, "Admin only");
    this.paused.value = Uint64(0);
  }

  private requireNotPaused(): void {
    assert(this.paused.value === Uint64(0), "Contract is paused");
  }

  public deposit(amount: uint64): void {
    this.requireNotPaused();
    // ... deposit logic
  }
}
```
